# Experimental Results

## Gather Data
* After running each version of the program, namely _Sequential_, _Threaded_ and _Process_, we collect runtimes and
store those in the following table, for posterior discussion. 

| Program Type |              Many Small Files |          Few Large Files |
|---           |------------------------------:|-------------------------:|
|Sequential    |                         0.592 |                   59.112 |
|Thread-based  |                         0.699 |                   54.112 |
|Process-based |                23.388         |  19.676                  |
 
## Discussion
* Discuss with your team these questions:

**A) Did the Multi-threaded program (thread-based) improve the performance of the processing?** 

*If yes, explain why? If no, explain what do you think is the cause of that behavior*
